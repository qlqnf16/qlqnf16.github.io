Understanding TypeScript : Section 7

---

Generic is flexible and re-usable code that only exits in TypeScript.

Type connected with other types. Array itself could be a type even if what kind of data goes in it. Certain type might work better if we provide information. give additional type explanation with complex function or so.

Generics help you create data structrue that work together or wrap values of broad variety of types. (e.g. an array that can hold any type of data)

```typescript
const names: string[] = [];
const names: Array<string> = [];
```

```typescript
const promise: Promise<string> = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("this is done!");
  }, 2000);
});

promise.then((data) => {
  data.split(" ");
});
```

- By defining generic type `Promise<string>`, we can safely use returned value `data` as string.

## Generic Functions

Typescript understands that we have specific types than unspecific random object.

```typescript
function merge(objA: object, objB: object) {
  return Object.assign(objA, objB);
}

const mergedObj = merge({ name: "MAX" }, { age: 30 });
mergedObj.age;
```

Let's say that we write code like above. The funciton `merge` is clear that it gets two objects as parameters and returns object. However the last line of the code will make compiling error because typescript is not sure if the object has `.age` property or not.

This is the point where Generic is needed most.

```typescript
function merge<T, U>(objA: T, objB: U) {
  return Object.assign(objA, objB);
}

const mergedObj = merge({ name: "MAX" }, { age: 30 });
mergedObj.age;
```

If we change the code like above, then this works fine.

- we made a function generic with bracket

- two single characters in the bracket means that there are two different types coming in, but these types are not random, but specific types.

- as we assign `T` in `objA` and `U` in `objB`, typescript wil understand that the function `merge` will eventually return `T & U` type by assigning two arguments.

  In example, by calling `merge({name: 'MAX'}, {age: 30})`, TS knows that type `{name: string}` and `{age: number}` are assigned together and therefore `{name: string, age: number}` type will be returned.

### Constraints

The code above has a problem. It cannot make sure that the function `merge` only accepts object type. Thus, if we pass number or string as an argument, it will not make any error during compiling but instead it wll fail silently during runtime.

By using **Constraints**, we can make sure that a generic type can be any form of object, not number or string.

```typescript
function merge<T extends object, U extends object>(objA: T, objB: U) {
  return Object.assign(objA, objB);
}

const mergedObj1 = merge("name", 30); // error
const mergedObj2 = merge({ name: "MAX" }, { age: 30 }); // works fine
mergedObj1.age; // error
mergedObj2.age; // works fine
```

##

```typescript
function extractAndConvert<T extends object, U extends keyof T>(
  obj: T,
  key: U
) {
  return obj[key];
}

extractAndConvert({}, "name");
extractAndConvert({ name: "Max" }, "name");
```

### Other example

```typescript
interface Lengthy {
  length: number;
}

function countAndPrint<T extends Lengthy>(element: T): [T, string] {
  let descriptionText = 'Got no value.';
  if (element.length === 1) {
    descriptionText = 'Got 1 element.'';
  } else if (element.length > 1) {
    descriptionText = `Got ${element.length} elements.`;
  }
  return [element, descriptionText];
}
```

by using Generic type, we don't have to care about the exact type, but whether if the type of argument has `length` property or not. Thus it makes code simpler by using Generic than union type or switch case or so.

## Generic Classes

By making generic classes, we can have full type support at the same time having flexibility.

```typescript
class DataStorage<T> {
  private data: T[] = [];

  addItem(item: T) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }

  removeItem(item: T) {
    this.data.splice(this.data.indexOf(item), 1);
  }

  getItems() {
    return [...this.data];
  }
}

const textStorgae = new DataStorage<string>();
textStorgae.addItem(10); // error
textStorgae.addItem("Max");

const numberStorage = new DataStorage<number>();
numberStorage.addItem(10);
numberStorage.addItem("Max"); // error
```

The example above has one problem that it does not work well **with non-primitive type such as Array or object.** By modifying the code like below, by adding constraint, we can ensure that the class **only accepts primitive type**.

```typescript
class DataStorage<T extends number | string | boolean> {...}

const objectStorage = new DataStorage<objet>();					// error
```

## Special Typescript Types

###

- `Partial<T>`: It's a generic that implements that the object will eventually be a certain type. If you make an interface inside the Partial generic, all property become optional.

- `Readonly<T>`: It can be modifiend when declared

## Difference between Generic and Union Type

use the same type through entire function or class.

```typescript
const data = extractData<string>(user, "userId");
```
